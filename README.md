# Vman-Trainee-Finder
A python script to search though all avaliable trainers in the webgame Vman and save them as an excel sheet


Things to fix:
Some links are broken (also it does not take the full name this way if more then 2 names are present)
Cannot always read the age and wage (might have something to do with the 2 names limit)
Very slow (7 seconds per page)
